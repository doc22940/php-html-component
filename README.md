# HTML Component by 8fold in PHP

A fetherweight class for generating predefined HTML or autonymous web components.

While developing [8fold UI](https://ui.8fold.software) we decided to rewrite [PHP HTML](https://github.com/8fold/php-html). In doing so, we concetrated the heavy lifting into a single class and decided to make it into its own package.
